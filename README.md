# HUNTED-HOUSE-GAME

Game Concept:
The game is a text-based horror adventure set in a haunted house. Players explore different rooms of the house by choosing directions (North, South, East, West). As they navigate, they encounter spooky events and may encounter a monster in the basement, which results in a game over.
Features:
 - Room Exploration: Players can move between different rooms within the house.
 - Spooky Events: Random spooky events occur in certain rooms, such as chilling sounds, ghostly figures, or cold drafts.
 - Monster Encounter: There's a chance of encountering a monster in the basement, leading to a game over.
 - Text-Based Interaction: Players interact with the game through text input, choosing their actions and navigating the environment.
   
Mechanics:
 - Movement: Players choose a direction (North, South, East, West) to move to the next room.
  Room Descriptions: Each room has a unique textual description that sets the atmosphere.
 - Random Events: Spooky events occur randomly in certain rooms, adding tension and unpredictability.
 - Monster Encounter: If the player enters the basement, there's a chance of encountering a monster, resulting in a game over.
   
Controls:
 - Players input their desired direction (1-4) to move between rooms.
   
Potential Bugs or Limitations:
 - Limited Interactivity: The current version is relatively basic. There's limited player interaction beyond moving between rooms.
 - Lack of Complexity: The game could be more challenging and engaging with the addition of puzzles, combat, or inventory systems.
 - Basic Spooky Events: The current spooky events are simple text descriptions. More elaborate events like sudden temperature drops, flickering lights could enhance the atmosphere.
 - Linearity: The game's progression is somewhat linear. Adding branching paths or multiple endings could increase replayability.
 - Lack of Visuals: As a text-based game, it lacks visual elements that could enhance the horror atmosphere.
